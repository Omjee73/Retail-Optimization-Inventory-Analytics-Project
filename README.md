## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving common retail inventory problems faced by a local kirana store, Siddhi General Store (Ballia, UP), through a data-driven approach.
Major issues addressed include shelf space mismanagement, monthly demand fluctuation, frequent stockouts, and low customer retention due to stock unavailability.

## Organization Background

Forecast monthly demand for better purchase planning.

Reduce frequent stockouts of high-demand products.

Improve profitability and customer loyalty through better inventory management.

## Methods & Tools Used

Methods	Tools
Bar Graph Analysis (Excess Stock Identification)	Python (Pandas, NumPy in Google Colab)
Time Series Analysis (Demand Trends)	Excel/Google Sheets
Scatter Plot Segmentation (Stockout Products)	Matplotlib
Data Cleaning and Manual Data Collection	ApnaClub App, Shop Records

## Key Analysis Techniques

Shelf Space Mismanagement Detection (Excess Quantity Calculation)

Monthly Demand Fluctuation Analysis (Threshold Line Analysis)

Stock-Out Product Detection (Sell Qty = Purchase Qty Rules)

Profitability Trend Analysis (Descriptive Stats: Mean, Quartiles)

## Key Insights

Some slow-moving products occupied high shelf space but gave negative profits.

Bulk purchases led to overstocking during off-seasons.

Certain products faced repeated stockouts leading to lost sales opportunities.

## Recommendations

Bundle slow-selling items with fast movers.

Sell excess inventory to local businesses (restaurants, sweet shops).

Strategic product placement near counters.

### Long-Term
Data-driven purchase planning based on seasonal trends.

Flexible supplier contracts to adjust for sudden demand spikes.
